# Fast Fourier Transforms 

The [Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) is an efficient algorithm to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its inverse. It is widely used in signal processing, image analysis, and solving partial differential equations. A typical issue is the physically correct scaling and calculation of respective axes.
